# Multiple-Disease-Prediction
This repository contains code for Support Vector Classification (SVC) and Logistic Regression methods for the prediction of various diseases, including as diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and heart disease. This study aims to show how machine learning techniques may be used to estimate the likelihood of certain diseases based on input features.
